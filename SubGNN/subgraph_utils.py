    Takes a matrix of vectors and a set of weights over the rows in the matrix (which we call an
    "attention" vector), and returns a weighted sum of the rows in the matrix.  This is the typical
    computation performed after an attention mechanism.
    Note that while we call this a "matrix" of vectors and an attention "vector", we also handle
    higher-order tensors.  We always sum over the second-to-last dimension of the "matrix", and we
    assume that all dimensions in the "matrix" prior to the last dimension are matched in the
    "vector".  Non-matched dimensions in the "vector" must be `directly after the batch dimension`.
    For example, say I have a "matrix" with dimensions `(batch_size, num_queries, num_words,
    embedding_dim)`.  The attention "vector" then must have at least those dimensions, and could
    have more. Both:
        - `(batch_size, num_queries, num_words)` (distribution over words for each query)
        - `(batch_size, num_documents, num_queries, num_words)` (distribution over words in a
          query for each document)
    are valid input "vectors", producing tensors of shape:
    `(batch_size, num_queries, embedding_dim)` and
    `(batch_size, num_documents, num_queries, embedding_dim)` respectively.
